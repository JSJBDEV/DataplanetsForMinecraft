# Dataplanets
A mod that uses slightly cursed registry manipulation to add infinite planets to space mods

# The Plan
- :green_circle: Rocky terrestrial planets
- :green_circle: (Rocky) sea planets
- :orange_circle: Stars
- :orange_circle: Gas Giants
  - Stars and gas giants are currently implemented the exact same way; A bedrock layer, 50 lava, 50 dense gas
  - This is basically finished, I just want to add flares/plumes at some point
- :red_circle: Creatures
  - :red_circle: Sea Creatures
  - :red_circle: Terrestrial Creatures
- :orange_circle: Space Stations
  - In this version, space stations will likely be supplied external
  - There is a basic implementation of modular space stations in this project
- :red_circle: Space Factions
  - Three factions are planned

# Things this version won't add
- Space Transportation
  - Space Transportation is usually handled externally with something like GCYR or Genesis
- Research System
  - Some mods would require a research system to have tangible progression to reach new systems
  - This is partially implemented for GCYR, but not needed for Genesis

This project is made with help and inspiration from team GTIC (more about them to come)
