# Dataplanets
A mod that uses slightly cursed ~~datapack generation (right now)~~ registry manipulation to add infinite planets to GCYR (right now)

# The Plan
- [x] Rocky terrestrial planets
- [x] (Rocky) sea planets
-  [ ] Research System
- [ ] Space navigation
  - [ ] Rockets
  -  [ ] Starships
- [ ] Gas Giants
- [ ] Creatures
  - [ ] Sea Creatures
  - [ ] Terrestrial Creatures
- [ ] Space stations 
- [ ] Story Events
- [ ] Space factions

# Notice
- This mod was originally made for 1.21 as originally posted on the GTCEU discord
- Originally the plan was to make an independent mod that adds universal content to every space mod, this is still the plan for this project
- This mod currently relies on GCYR, eventually it will be universal (I hope)
- eventually this mod may not depend on GTCEU, however I thought it was better to work with a base tech mod first
  - this is also because it means I can add lakes of cool fluids from GTCEU

This project is made with help and inspiration from team GTIC (more about them to come)
