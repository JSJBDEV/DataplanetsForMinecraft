# Dataplanets
A mod that uses slightly cursed ~~datapack generation (right now)~~ registry manipulation to add infinite planets to GCYR (right now)

# The Plan
- :green_circle: Rocky terrestrial planets
- :green_circle: (Rocky) sea planets
- :orange_circle: Research System
- :orange_circle: Stars
- :orange_circle: Gas Giants
- :red_circle: Creatures
  - :red_circle: Sea Creatures
  - :red_circle: Terrestrial Creatures
- :orange_circle: Space stations 
- :red_circle: Story Events
- :red_circle: Space factions
- ~~Space navigation~~
  - ~~Rockets (uses GCYR)~~
  - ~~Starships~~

# Notice
- This mod was originally made for 1.21 as originally posted on the GTCEU discord
- Originally the plan was to make an independent mod that adds universal content to every space mod, this is still the plan for this project
- This mod currently relies on GCYR, eventually it will be universal (I hope)
- eventually this mod may not depend on GTCEU, however I thought it was better to work with a base tech mod first
  - this is also because it means I can add lakes of cool fluids from GTCEU

This project is made with help and inspiration from team GTIC (more about them to come)
