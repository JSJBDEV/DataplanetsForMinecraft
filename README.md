# Dataplanets
A mod that uses slightly cursed datapack generation (right now) to add infinite planets to GCYR (right now)

# Notice
- This mod was originally made for 1.21 as originally posted on the GTCEU discord
- Originally the plan was to make an independent mod that adds universal content to every space mod, this is still the plan for this project
- This mod currently relies on GCYR, eventually it will be universal (I hope)
- eventually this mod may not depend on GTCEU, however I thought it was better to work with a base tech mod first
  - this is also because it means I can add lakes of cool fluids from GTCEU
